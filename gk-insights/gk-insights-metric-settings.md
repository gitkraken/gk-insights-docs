## Release Tracking

Configure how GitKraken Insights detects new releases for your repositories.

### Rules to detect releases

The **Rules to detect releases** list shows all active release rules for your organization. Each rule displays:

- The rule type
- A summary of the matching condition
- The number of releases and repositories matched
- Who created the rule

The following rule types appear in your list:

- **Contains Branch Prefix** — Matches commits pushed to a branch that starts with a specified string.
- **Merged Pull Request To Branch Prefix** — Matches commits that merge a pull request to a branch with a specified prefix.
- **Any Git Tag** — Matches commits with any git tag pushed.
- **Matches Branch** — Matches commits made to a specific branch.
- **Api Call** — Matches releases reported via API call.

To remove a rule, click the **✕** icon on the right side of the rule.

## Detect Issues

GitKraken Insights uses issue mappings to connect commits to issues in your issue tracking software (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues). Each mapping defines a pattern that GitKraken Insights matches against commit messages, branch names, and pull request titles to identify the issues they address.

If GitKraken Insights does not display a pattern you expect, click **Find new issue tracker patterns** at the top of the page.

<figure>
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/find-new-issue-tracker-patterns.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="Detect Issue References page header showing the Find new issue tracker patterns link highlighted" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">Click Find new issue tracker patterns at the top of the Detect Issue References page to search for additional patterns.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Issue mappings

The **Detect Issue References** page lists all active issue mappings for your organization. Each mapping displays:

- **Available to** — the repositories the mapping applies to
- **Issue Reference** — the string GitKraken Insights matches against commit messages, branch names, and PR titles
- **Project Key** — the corresponding project key in your issue tracker
- **Usage** — the number of repo issues and commits matched by this mapping

To delete a mapping, click **Delete issue mapping** within the mapping card.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">The Detect Issue References page lists all active issue mappings for your organization.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Suggested issue tracking patterns

When GitKraken Insights detects potential issue tracking patterns in your repositories, it displays suggested mappings at the top of the Detect Issue References page. Each suggestion includes a pre-filled **Create Issue Mapping** form showing:

- **Available to** — the repository where the pattern was detected
- **Issue Reference** — the detected reference string
- **Project Key** — the corresponding project key (if detected)
- **Advanced options** — additional configuration options

<!-- FLAG FOR HUMAN REVIEW: The contents of "Advanced options" are not visible in available screenshots. -->

The **Matching Commits** panel on the right previews commits that match the current **Issue Reference** input in real time.

To accept a suggestion:

1. Review the **Issue Reference** and **Project Key** fields.
2. Click **Create a new issue mapping**.

To decline a suggestion, click **Dismiss suggestion**.

## Define Issue Tracker Projects

The **Define issue tracker projects** page lists all issue tracker projects connected to your organization. GitKraken Insights uses the configuration on this page to read story point values and identify critical defects for DORA and code quality metric calculations.

### Project configuration

Each connected project appears as a card with the following fields:

- **Project Key** — the unique key that identifies the project in your issue tracker
- **Project Home** — a link to the project in your issue tracker
- **Referenced by Repos** — the repositories that reference this project
- **Story Point Field** — the field GitKraken Insights reads for story point values
- **Critical Defect Field** — the field values that identify a critical defect. Click **Add another defect mapping** to add additional values, or **Copy existing defect mapping** to duplicate an existing one.

<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">Each project card displays story point and critical defect configuration fields, along with actions to refresh fields or hide the project.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each project card includes two actions:

- **Refresh list of fields** — manually fetches the latest fields from your issue tracker. Use this only when you have added a new field to your project and need it available immediately. GitClear automatically refreshes project fields every few days and when new projects are added.
- **Hide project** — removes the project from this list.

</figure>

### Rescan for Projects

When you configure a new issue tracker connection, GitKraken Insights automatically scans for projects and populates the list above. If a newly added project does not appear, or if you are having problems seeing an expected project, click **Rescan projects** next to the relevant connection to manually fetch the latest project list.

To view all issue tracker connections, including those ineligible for project scanning, click **Issue Tracker Connections**.

## Critical Defect Terms

The **Critical defect terms** page lets you define terms that GitKraken Insights uses to automatically detect critical defect bugs. When a term matches, GitKraken Insights flags the associated work as a critical defect in DORA metric calculations.

GitKraken Insights performs case-insensitive substring matching against:

- The name of the branch (e.g., `hotfix/login-crash`)
- The title of the linked issue (e.g., `[BUG] Login page crashes on submit`)
- The title of the pull request (e.g., `Fix critical auth bug in production`)

### Existing terms

Active defect detection terms appear in a list with the following columns:

- **Term** — the string GitKraken Insights matches against branches, issues, and pull requests
- **Repos** — the repositories where the term is applied
- **Actions** — click **Delete** to remove the term

### Add a defect detection term

To add a new term, enter a string in the **Add New Defect Detection Term** field (e.g., `bug`, `fix`, `hotfix`) and click **Add Term**.

## Measurement Configuration

The **Measurement configuration** page lets you define Code Domains for your organization. Code Domains use regular expressions to group files by area of the codebase, letting you identify where each engineer contributes.

If you need help configuring Code Domains optimally for your organization, contact GitKraken support at [support@gitkraken.com](mailto:support@gitkraken.com).

### Existing Code Domains

The **Existing Code Domains** list displays all configured domains for your organization. Each domain shows:

- **Domain name** — the label for the domain, with an edit icon to modify it
- **Regex pattern** — the regular expression GitKraken Insights uses to match files to this domain
- **Diff Delta multiplier** — a scalar applied when calculating the Diff Delta of code written in files that match this domain
- **File matches** — the number of files and repositories matched by the regex

<!-- FLAG FOR HUMAN REVIEW: The expand arrow behavior on each domain card is not confirmed. -->

</figure>

### Add a Code Domain

<!-- FLAG FOR HUMAN REVIEW: How the Add a Code Domain form is accessed is not visible in available screenshots. -->

The **Add a Code Domain** form contains the following fields:

- **Select or create a Code Domain** — choose a preset domain type from the dropdown, or type a new name to create a custom domain. Available preset options include: Autogenerated, C#, CSS, Compiled build files, Configuration, Controller, Data source, Database, Database migration, Dependency config, Perl, Python, React Component, SQL, SQL (View), Test, Test (JS), Test (Python), Test fixture, and Third-party.
- **Define a regular expression** — enter a regex pattern describing the file paths to include in this domain (e.g., `models\/.*\.rb` matches every `.rb` file in a `models` directory)

As you type a regular expression, the **Files matching your regular expression** panel previews which files match the pattern in real time.

To create the domain, click **Create Code Domain**. The domain applies to all repositories in your organization.
