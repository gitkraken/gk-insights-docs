## Overview

GitKraken Insights brings your Git data, pull requests, issues, and CI/CD results into one place. Instead of juggling tools or exporting spreadsheets, you get dashboards that show how work is really moving across code, reviews, and releases. The goal is to give both devs and leads a clear view of progress and bottlenecks without extra reporting overhead.

### Key benefits

- **In your workflow:** Metrics come straight from the tools you already use: Git, PRs, CI/CD, issue trackers. No duplicate work, no disruption.  
- **Useful context:** See how code changes connect to tickets, review quality, and team goals. Less vanity stats, more signal.  
- **Clear next steps:** Spot inefficiencies and get practical ways to improve, whether it’s review speed, investment in features vs. fixes, or build times.

## DORA metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are a standardized set of four key performance indicators: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service. 

Developed by a Google Cloud research team, these metrics help organizations measure DevOps performance, identify areas for improvement, and deliver software more efficiently and reliably.

### Deploy Frequency

**Definition:** _The total number of deployments, as determined by the rules configured in the **Releases** settings._

This metric shows how often new code is released or deployed to production, measured as the number of deployments per day, week, or other selected timeframe.

<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">Shows how long each PR took from first commit to deployment.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Mean Time to Repair/Recover (MTTR)

**Definition:** _Business hours between "defect detected" and "final fix deployed"._

This metric shows how long each pull request within a selected timeframe took to go from the first commit until it was deployed. Values are expressed in **days** and calculated over a rolling **7-day period**. Lower MTTR indicates that teams can respond quickly to incidents and minimize downtime.

### Defect Rate

**Definition:** _The percentage of deployments that resolve a critical defect. This metric measures the stability and quality of your deployment process._

This metric shows the number of defects detected over time. Values are expressed as **defects** over a rolling **7-day window**. A lower defect rate indicates a more stable and reliable deployment process.

***

## Pull Request metrics

Pull Request metrics help teams understand how quickly and smoothly code changes move through review and deployment. 

PR intelligence turns these insights into clear actions by highlighting slowdowns, spotting patterns in fast or delayed reviews, and uncovering blockers that may affect delivery.

### First Response Time ("Pickup Time")

**Definition:** _The time measured from when a PR is opened to when the 1st review or comment is left on a PR._

This metric shows how long each pull request within a selected timeframe took to have a first response (comment or review). Values are expressed in **hours** and averaged over a **7-day period**. Shorter pickup times indicate faster reviewer engagement and healthier collaboration.

<figure>
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/first-response-time.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/first-response-time@2x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="Overview of GitKraken Insights" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #888">Average time it took for PR to receive comment or review.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Cycle Time ("first commit" to "merge")

**Definition:** _The time measured between the 1st commit of a PR to when the PR is merged._

This metric shows how long each pull request within a selected timeframe took to merge from the time the first commit was made. Values are expressed in **days** and averaged over a **7-day period**. Cycle time provides insight into overall delivery speed, highlighting how quickly work moves from coding to production.

<figure>
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/cycle-time-line.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/cycle-time-line@2x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered" alt="Overview of GitKraken Insights" />

## Trendlines

You can add trendlines to any chart in GitKraken Insights to help visualize patterns over time. These overlays make it easier to understand whether your metrics are improving, declining, or fluctuating—and how consistently.

### How to add a trendline

1. On any dashboard widget, click the **⋯ (three dots)** menu in the upper-right corner.
2. Select **Set trendline**.
3. Choose one of the available types:

- **None:** No trendline is shown.
- **Linear:** Adds a straight line through the data to show steady upward or downward trends.
- **Polynomial:** Adds a curved line that reveals acceleration, deceleration, or changing directions in the data.
- **Moving Average:** Smooths out short-term fluctuations to highlight the overall pattern, especially useful for noisy or jumpy data.

> **Tip:** Use trendlines to spot steady improvements, regressions, or shifts in behavior across delivery, review, or quality metrics.

## Filters

The dashboard may be filtered by **Workspace**, **Repositories**, **Timeframe**, and **Team**.

- **Workspace:** Workspaces are preset groups of repositories. They also enable other key features across gitkraken.dev, GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, and the GitKraken CLI such as Launchpad and multi-repo actions. On the dashboard, you can filter to only display data for the repositories in your chosen Workspace. To create your first workspace, go to [gitkraken.dev/workspaces](https://gitkraken.dev/workspaces).

- **Repositories:** Refers to the list of repos imported into GitKraken Insights. Check or uncheck repositories to fine-tune the data. Use the search feature to quickly locate repos by name.

- **Timeframe:** Sets the timebox for the dashboard. Options include **This Week, Last Week, Last 7 days, Last 14 days, Last 28 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days, Last 12 months**, or a custom date range.

- **Team:** Filters the data by a group of users. To configure teams, go to **Insights > Settings > Setup your Team**.
