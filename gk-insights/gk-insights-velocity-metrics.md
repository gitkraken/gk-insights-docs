GitKraken Insights tracks two Velocity and Delivery Consistency metrics that reflect development rhythm. Tracking commit volume and coding hours helps teams assess delivery patterns and ensure developers have time for focused work. Use these alongside DORA and Pull Request metrics for a complete view of delivery health.

> **Plan:** GitKraken Insights
> **Platform:** Browser only via [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev)
> **Role:** Lead, Admin, or Owner
> **Prerequisite:** Connected repositories with commit history

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Commit Count | Number of commits pushed to all connected repositories |
| Estimated Coding Hours | Estimated time developers spend coding |

> **Commit Count** measures activity volume. **Estimated Coding Hours** measures time investment. Neither is a standalone productivity metric. Use them together with DORA and PR metrics to understand delivery patterns.

## Commit Count

**Definition:** _The number of commits pushed to all connected repositories._

Commit Count tracks the volume of code commits over time, offering a basic signal of development activity. While not a productivity metric on its own, it can help identify engagement patterns, team rhythm, and delivery frequency.

## Estimated Coding Hours

**Definition:** _Estimates the amount of time a team's developers spend coding._

Estimated Coding Hours approximates the total active development time across your team. It helps leaders assess engineering capacity, detect shifts in focus time, and understand whether developers are able to engage in deep work versus being blocked or interrupted.
