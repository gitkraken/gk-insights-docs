This is the hands-on setup guide for AI Adoption in GitKraken Insights. By the end, your organization's GitHub activity and AI coding-tool telemetry will be flowing into the dashboard, your developers will be mapped to a single identity, and your team will have access.

Plan on **15–20 minutes of active work**, plus up to a day for the first full data sync to complete in the background.

> **Plan:** GitKraken Insights
> **Platform:** Browser only via [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev)
> **Role:** Owner or Admin (to manage data connections)
> **Where you'll work:** **Insights → Settings → Data Connections**

> **Note — this is the Next-Gen (AI Adoption) connection flow.** AI Adoption connects through **org-level access tokens** in Settings → Data Connections. This is different from the classic Insights repository connection (the OAuth "Authorize GitHub" flow described in [Getting Started with GitKraken Insights](/gk-insights/gk-insights#connecting-your-data)). If you're setting up AI Adoption, follow the steps on this page.

## Before you start — gather access

The single biggest cause of stalled setups is discovering mid-stream that the person doing the setup doesn't have the right permissions. Setup almost always touches **two or three different people** across your org. Line them up *before* you begin.

| You'll need… | …who has this access | What they'll do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitKraken organization** | Owner or Admin of your gk.dev org | Manage data connections, invite teammates |
| **GitHub** | An org admin (to create an org-level token) | Generate the GitHub access token |
| **Claude Code / Codex** | The **Owner** of your Anthropic (Claude Code) organization — *admins cannot do this* | Paste the telemetry snippet into org-managed settings |
| **Cursor** | A Cursor **team admin** | Create a team-level admin API key |
| **Jira** (optional) | A Jira admin | Create an API token |

> **Start the GitHub token request now.** In larger orgs, getting approval to create a GitHub token with the right scope can take days — sometimes weeks. It's the most common bottleneck, so kick it off before anything else.

> **Only Owners and Admins can connect data.** If you open Settings → Data Connections and see a read-only banner, you'll need an org Owner or Admin to either make the connections or grant you access.

## Step 1 — Connect GitHub

GitHub is the foundation. It powers every PR, commit, contributor, and cycle-time metric — without it, the dashboards stay empty.

1. In gitkraken.dev, open **Insights → Settings → Data Connections**.
2. On the **GitHub** card, click **Connect**.
3. In GitHub, create a token (see scopes below), paste it into the field, click **Validate**, then **Connect**.

### Fine-grained vs. classic token

Either works. The tradeoffs:

| | Fine-grained PAT | Classic PAT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Org selection** | We can't auto-fetch your orgs — you'll type the org name in manually | We can list your orgs in a dropdown |
| **Best for** | Tightly-scoped, single-org setups | Multi-org setups, or excluding specific orgs |

We generally recommend a **fine-grained token scoped to your organization**.

### Required permissions (read-only)

Create the token at **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**. Set the **Resource owner** to your organization (not your personal account) so the token can see org repositories.

**Fine-grained token — Repository permissions (Read-only):**

- **Metadata** — *Read* (selected automatically; required)
- **Contents** — *Read*
- **Pull requests** — *Read*

**Recommended — Organization permissions (Read-only):**

- **Members** — *Read* — lets us match GitHub identities to people on your roster, which makes [identity mapping](#step-5--map-developer-identities) far smoother.

> If you use a **classic** token instead, select the **`repo`** (read) and **`read:org`** scopes.

> **You can edit a token's scopes after creating it** — you don't need to regenerate it if you missed one. (Note: GitHub does *not* let you change a token's expiration after creation, so set a comfortably long expiry up front.)

Once connected, GitHub data begins syncing in the background and continues over the next several hours.

## Step 2 — Connect your AI coding tools

Connect **at least one** AI provider — this is what lets Insights *measure* adoption instead of guessing at it. Connect as many as your team uses.

### Claude Code and Codex (OpenTelemetry)

Claude Code and Codex report usage through OpenTelemetry (OTel). You'll paste a small configuration snippet into your AI tool's **organization-managed settings**.

1. In **Data Connections**, click **Connect** on the **Claude Code / Codex** card, then **View setup**.
2. Copy the configuration snippet (use the copy icon). GitKraken has already generated your organization's telemetry token and endpoint inside it.
3. Have your Anthropic **organization Owner** paste the snippet into your org-managed Claude Code settings.

> **This requires the Claude Code organization Owner.** Admins do not have permission to change org-managed settings.

> **Heads-up for your developers — warn them first.** The moment org telemetry settings change, Anthropic notifies *every developer* on their next Claude Code session that organization settings were modified, and the notice uses deliberately cautious wording (it warns that changed settings *could* run code). This is Anthropic's standard behavior, not GitKraken's. Send your team a quick message ahead of time so no one is surprised. Suggested note:
>
> > *"Heads up — we're turning on Claude Code usage telemetry for the team so we can measure AI adoption. On your next Claude Code session you'll see a notice that org settings changed; that's expected — go ahead and accept it. We are not collecting your prompts."*

> **Privacy:** the default snippet collects usage and session telemetry (tokens used, duration, tool calls) — **not prompt content**. Anthropic publishes documentation on this telemetry, and there is a separate opt-in flag some orgs add to capture prompts; the snippet we generate does **not** enable it.

> **Data appears on the next fresh session.** There's no backfill — usage starts flowing the next time each developer runs Claude Code or Codex after the settings are applied. (Claude Code OTel instrumentation began March 5, 2026; activity before that date isn't available.)

### Cursor (API key)

1. In Cursor, go to **Settings → API Keys → Create New Key**.
2. Create a **team-level** key with **admin scope** (this grants access to *team usage events* and the *member directory*). Name it something recognizable, e.g. "GitKraken Insights."
3. Copy the key immediately — Cursor only shows it once.
4. Back in **Data Connections**, click **Connect** on the **Cursor** card, paste the key, and connect.

> A **personal** key, or a key from a non-admin account, won't have access to team usage data. It must be a team-level admin key.

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot support is on the way. Copilot returns a narrower set of data than Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor, so some metrics will be partial. Your account team will let you know when it's available to connect.

---

## Step 3 — Connect Jira (optional, recommended)

Jira gives Insights cycle-time start signals and customer-bug data, so AI Impact compares like-for-like work across tools. You can add it now or any time later.

1. Go to [**id.atlassian.com → Security → API tokens**](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
2. Click **Create API token** — **not** "Create API token with scopes."
3. In **Data Connections**, click **Connect** on the **Jira** card and enter:
   - the **API token**,
   - the **account email** the token was created for,
   - your **Jira instance URL**.

> **Scoped tokens aren't supported yet.** Jira's newer "API token with scopes" option won't work — use the plain **Create API token** option. (The Atlassian token page is easy to miss; the link above goes straight to it.)

---

## Step 4 — Set your benchmarks

A few business inputs let Insights translate engineering activity into ROI and tier your developers correctly. Sensible defaults are pre-filled — confirm or adjust in **Settings → General**:

- **Developer Hourly Rate** — used for ROI / time-saved-to-dollars on AI Impact.
- **Baseline Period** — the "before" date AI-adoption lift is measured against.
- **Maturity Factor** (Company AI Readiness %) — an org-wide scaling knob; the 0.75 default suits most orgs.
- **Default Department** — pre-selects the right view for first-time visitors.

You can change all of these at any time. For what each setting affects, see the [AI Adoption Settings reference](/gk-insights/ai-adoption-settings).

## Step 5 — Map developer identities

This is the step that makes or breaks clean data. The same person often shows up under several identities — a GitHub login, one or more commit emails, a Jira account. Until those are merged, your leaderboards and adoption metrics double-count, and you end up with "parallel universes" of the same developer.

1. After GitHub has been processing for a bit (allow ~12 hours), open **Settings → Developers**.
2. Review the detected identities. Where you recognize duplicates of the same person, use **Merge** to combine them.
3. Where an identity is missing an email, add it — this helps tie commit data back to the right person.

Insights auto-suggests matches using email, GitHub handle, and name, but you should confirm them and clean up anything it couldn't resolve. **Treat this like an inbox and keep it empty** — see the [For admins](/gk-insights/ai-adoption-getting-started#for-admins) page for ongoing roster hygiene.

### Excluding review bots

AI code-review bots — such as **GitHub Copilot review** or Atlassian **Rovo** — leave activity on pull requests, so Insights detects them as contributors. If you'd rather they not appear as developers in your metrics, you can exclude them from the roster in **Settings → Developers**.

## Step 6 — Invite your team

Give the rest of your stakeholders access so they can read the dashboards.

1. From the gk.dev sidebar, go back to the **main menu** and open **Users**.
2. Click **Add users** and invite people by email, or share the invite link.
3. Give each person at least an **Admin** or **Lead** role so they can view Insights.

> **If you invite by link:** new users land with a default role, so you'll need to adjust their role to **Admin** or **Lead** after they create their account.

## What to expect after setup

- **First data:** the last month of GitHub activity typically appears within a few hours; a full year usually lands within one to two days.
- **AI tool data:** starts flowing on each developer's next Claude Code / Codex / Cursor session — there's no backfill before the connection was made.
- **Sync status:** each connection on the Data Connections page shows a health status. If a connection looks degraded or errored, that's the first place to check — and let your account team know.
- **Coming soon:** **GitHub Copilot** telemetry and **Bitbucket** support (with aggregated multi-provider dashboards, so GitHub and Bitbucket activity show side by side). Your account team will confirm availability.

## Troubleshooting setup

| Symptom | What's happening | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Read-only banner** on Data Connections or Settings | Your gk.dev role can't manage connections | Ask an org Owner or Admin to connect, or to grant you access |
| **GitHub token validates, then "Connect" won't enable** | Occasional UI hiccup where re-validating clears the token | Refresh the browser, paste the token once, then Validate → Connect |
| **No orgs to select after connecting GitHub** | Expected with a **fine-grained** token — we can't auto-fetch orgs | Type your GitHub org name in manually |
| **Can't create the Cursor key / no usage data** | Key isn't team-level admin, or your Cursor role is too low | Have a Cursor team admin create a **team-level admin** key |
| **Can't change Claude Code org settings** | You're an admin, not the org Owner | Only the Anthropic org **Owner** can apply the telemetry snippet |
| **Jira token rejected** | A *scoped* token was created | Recreate with plain **Create API token** (no scopes) |
| **A developer appears twice** | Multiple identities not yet merged | Merge them in Settings → Developers (Step 5) |
| **Setup email flagged by your IT as suspicious** | Some corporate filters flag new domains | Navigate directly to [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev) instead of clicking the email link; tell your account team |

If a problem persists, contact your GitKraken account team with the page URL, what you were connecting, and a screenshot of any error.
